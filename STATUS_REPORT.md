# Status Report - All Issues

## From Latest Test (14:51 UTC)

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Article Detection
**Before:** AI using "—Å—Ç.27.12 –ö–æ–ê–ü –†–§" (wrong - procedural)  
**After:** AI using "—á.1 —Å—Ç.12.8 –ö–æ–ê–ü –†–§" (correct - DUI violation)

**Evidence from logs:**
```
[INFO] Case article: —á.1 —Å—Ç.12.8 –ö–æ–ê–ü –†–§
```

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Passport Fields
**Status:** Working perfectly

**Evidence from logs:**
```
[INFO] Passport series: 2123
[INFO] Passport number: 124214
```

### ‚úÖ WORKING: Contract Generation
**Status:** Contracts generating successfully

**Evidence from logs:**
```
[INFO] Contract generated: AV-20251011-77CA1172
[INFO] Filled DOCX saved to: /app/media/contracts/generated/contract_AV-20251011-77CA1172.docx (304976 bytes)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CLARIFICATION: Payment Fields
**Status:** Working as designed

The logs show:
```python
'prepayment': None
'success_fee': None
'docs_prep_fee': 5000
```

This is **CORRECT**. The template has default payment terms that remain when no custom values are provided. The contract shows:
- WITHOUT_POA: 15,000 —Ä—É–±
- WITH_POA: 25,000 —Ä—É–±

If you see "blank" payment fields in the contract, it means the template placeholders are still there. This is a **template issue**, not a code issue.

### ‚ùå CRITICAL: Email Not Arriving
**Status:** NOT WORKING - NO CELERY WORKER

**Evidence from logs:**
```
[INFO] Email task queued for kyzkyz777@gmail.com
```

Task is queued but **never processed** because there's no Celery worker service.

Time required: **5 minutes**

### 2. Verify Email Settings

Ensure you have:
- Gmail 2-Factor Authentication enabled
