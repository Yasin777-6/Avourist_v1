# üêõ BUGFIX: Bot Asks for Contract Too Early

## üî¥ Bug Report

**Issue:** Bot immediately asks for contract data on first message, skipping the trust-building flow.

**Example:**
```
User: "–Ø —Å–±–∏–ª –ø–µ—à–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∞"
Bot: "–î–ª—è –æ—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∞ –º–Ω–µ –Ω—É–∂–Ω—ã –ø–∞—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ..." ‚ùå WRONG!
```

**Expected:**
```
User: "–Ø —Å–±–∏–ª –ø–µ—à–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∞"
Bot: "–†–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∂–∏—Ç–µ –ø–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–µ–µ –æ —Å–∏—Ç—É–∞—Ü–∏–∏..." ‚úÖ CORRECT!
```

**Root Cause:** Orchestrator routes to Contract Agent if `lead.status == 'HOT'`, but lead becomes HOT too early (after first message).

**Log Evidence:**
```
[INFO] Lead is HOT with pricing - routing to contract
[INFO] ContractAgent processing message
```

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### **Removed Premature Contract Routing:**

**Before (Lines 89-92):**
```python
# If lead has pricing and is HOT, suggest contract
if lead.status == 'HOT' and lead.estimated_cost:
    logger.info("Lead is HOT with pricing - routing to contract")
    return 'contract'
```

**After:**
```python
# Only route to contract if client EXPLICITLY wants contract
# Don't route just because lead is HOT - that's too early!
# Client must first see value (analysis, petition, pricing)
```

## üìä Correct Flow Now

### **Trust-Building Flow:**

```
1. User: "–Ø —Å–±–∏–ª –ø–µ—à–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∞"
   ‚Üí Route to: Intake Agent
   ‚Üí Bot: "–†–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∂–∏—Ç–µ –ø–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–µ–µ..."

2. User: "–î–∞" (confirms case)
   ‚Üí Route to: Intake Agent
   ‚Üí Bot: "–ü—Ä–∏—à–ª–∏—Ç–µ –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –¥–ª—è –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞"

3. User: [Sends photo]
   ‚Üí Route to: Intake Agent
   ‚Üí Bot: [Free expert analysis + violations found]

4. User: "–ß—Ç–æ –¥–∞–ª—å—à–µ?"
   ‚Üí Route to: Pricing Agent
   ‚Üí Bot: [ROI calculation + pricing]

5. User: "–î–∞–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ –æ—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏–º"
   ‚Üí Route to: Contract Agent
   ‚Üí Bot: "–î–ª—è –¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∞ –Ω—É–∂–Ω—ã –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ..."
```

## üéØ When to Route to Contract Agent

**ONLY when client explicitly says:**
- "–¥–∞–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ –æ—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏–º"
- "—Ö–æ—á—É –¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä"
- "–æ—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ç–µ –¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä"
- "–∑–∞–∫–ª—é—á–∏–º –¥–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä"

**NOT when:**
- ‚ùå Lead status is HOT
- ‚ùå Lead has estimated_cost
- ‚ùå First message from client
- ‚ùå Client asks questions

## üìÅ File Modified

- ‚úÖ `ai_engine/agents/orchestrator.py` - Removed premature contract routing

## üß™ Test Case

**Scenario: New client with DUI case**

```
1. User: "–ú–µ–Ω—è –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–ª–∏ –ø—å—è–Ω—ã–º"
   Expected: Intake Agent (article identification) ‚úÖ
   
2. User: "–î–∞"
   Expected: Intake Agent (document request) ‚úÖ
   
3. User: [Photo]
   Expected: Intake Agent (expert analysis) ‚úÖ
   
4. User: "–°–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç?"
   Expected: Pricing Agent (ROI + pricing) ‚úÖ
   
5. User: "–î–∞–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ –æ—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏–º"
   Expected: Contract Agent (passport data request) ‚úÖ
```

**Before Fix:**
- Step 1 ‚Üí Contract Agent ‚ùå (asks for passport immediately)

**After Fix:**
- Step 1 ‚Üí Intake Agent ‚úÖ (builds trust first)

## üéØ Summary of All Bugs Fixed

### **Bug 1: Documents sent for all messages** ‚úÖ
- Only petitions sent as .docx

### **Bug 2: Wrong article in contract** ‚úÖ
- Use Lead's case_type

### **Bug 3: Contract contains petition text** ‚úÖ
- Ignore history fluff

### **Bug 4: Bot asks for contract too early** ‚úÖ
- Build trust first, contract last
